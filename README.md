# Advent of Code 2025


For this year, I'll be using GDscript which is the scripting language for the game engine Godot.



To execute these examples, you will have to down Godot and then import this project once it's been checked out. Godot can be downloaded here: [https://godotengine.org/download/](https://godotengine.org/download/)
